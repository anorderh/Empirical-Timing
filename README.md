This repository contains the implementation and test driver for data structure "SortedArrayList". Made using arrays, its contents always remain in order despite lacking an explicit sort function.
The associated driver is designed to test the time compelxity of 4 processes.
	1. Adding in order until full - Linear
	2. Adding in reverse until full - Quadratic
	3. Removing until empty (remove at index 0) - Quadratic
	4. Clearing SAL - Constant
